## Middlewares

The store has the following middlewares;

* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) - middleware for handling asynchronous actions. It allows action creators to return a function, instead of an action object, which can be used to dispatch multiple actions or perform async logic.
* [New Middleware Name](https://new-middleware-docs) - Description of the new middleware.
