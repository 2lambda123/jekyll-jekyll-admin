## Middlewares

The store has the following middlewares;

* [Redux Thunk](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic) - allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
* [Redux Logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) - Logs fired actions to the console.
