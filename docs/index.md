  A Jekyll plugin that provides users with a traditional CMS-style graphical interface to author content and administer Jekyll
  sites. The project is divided into two parts. A Ruby-based HTTP API that handles Jekyll and filesystem operations, and a
  Javascript-based front end, built on that API.
---

## Installation

Refer to [Install Plugins](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#installing-a-plugin) in Jekyll docs and install the `jekyll-admin`
plugin as you would normally by adding `jekyll-admin` to the `:jekyll_plugins` group in your `Gemfile` (or) to the `gems` list
in your `_config.yml`.

## Usage

1. Start Jekyll by running the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
2. To access the administrative interface, open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:4000/admin`. Then, log in using your Jekyll credentials.
